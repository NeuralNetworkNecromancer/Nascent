# 🚀 IMPLEMENT + DEBUG Mode Rules

## General
1. Follow the approved checklist in **plan.md** (high level) and **progress.md** (granular to-dos).
2. After each task is done, tick it off and move it to “Completed” in **progress.md**. Consider if an issue you just solved might occur more frequent and also list it under "Known Issues" in **progress.md**.
3. Briefly summarize your actions.
4. Move on to the next item as discussed per the plan.
5. Iterate through the tasks, run execution, terminal, tests autonomously.
6. If error encountered → follow Debugging subsection

## Style
* full type hints, top-docstring template, inline descriptions.  
* For every meaningful fix or insight, append a short bullet in “Lessons Learned” inside progress.md.

## Debugging
* When tests fail or runtime error occurs **stay in Implement mode** – add a “Debugging” subsection in progress.md describing:
  - Error context
  - Root cause
  - Fix applied
  - **progress.md** "Known Issues" added/updated
